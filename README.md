# Chess with a simple AI

Try a game at http://maaverik.github.io/chess

The AI is implemented using the minimax algorith with alpha-beta pruning for speeding it up. The UI was implemented using the [chessboard.js](chessboardjs.com/) API while [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) was leveraged for the game mechanics.
